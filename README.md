Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This one was pretty fun - I thought it would be simple, but I ended up learning how to work with pseudo-selectors using JavaScript, which was an interesting rabbit hole. 
I added some JavaScript to adjust the positioning of the navigation tooltip on the fly for desktop when the screen is resized - Handling the ::after pseudo-selector through JavaScript was challenging, but now I know how to do it for future projects!

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass/SCSS
- BEM
- JavaScript

# Looking Back
- I think for a normal use it works fine - I'm not happy with how I did things for the mobile display, because the share navigation doesn't have quite the same position for the share button so it feels a bit weird.
- I added some JS to make the share navigation on desktop adjust its position on the fly when the screen is resized - That was pretty fun to figure out and I'm mostly happy with how it turned out. If you resize it very, very quickly back and forth the position ends up not being correct some times, but I'm not sure if I can do much about that - I think it would be fine for regular use?
- I also used an img element instead of a background image to crop the picture exactly like it is in the design - I am not sure if there was a way to achieve the same result this way, but I wanted to make the image accessible instead of using a background image.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
